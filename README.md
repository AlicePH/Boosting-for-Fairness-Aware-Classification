# Boosting-for-Fairness-Aware-Classification
The project focuses on fairness-aware classification in machine learning, aiming to mitigate algorithms' bias towards minorities in various domains such as job hiring or loan credit. The problem is reduced to imbalanced classification and minority class prediction. The project involves reproducing, improving, and creating new algorithms and models for fairness-aware classification. The provided papers explore different algorithms for imbalanced classification using real-world datasets, including UCI Adult Census and UCI KDD Census. We will reproduce the models described in the articles and use the datasets for training and testing. The project aims to contribute to the current research on fairness-aware classification, which is a hot topic in the international machine learning community. By developing more accurate and fair algorithms, the project can lead to more ethical and unbiased decision-making processes in various domains.
